# Website from Safari reading list

To generate the website from the `website` folder, run:

```bash
python website.py reading_list.json reading_list_icons
```

(You must already have the `reading_list.json` and `readling_list_icons` - see main package). The output is in the `website_out` folder - specifically [website_out/index.html](website_out/index.html).
